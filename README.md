# UIC Art 150 | Drawing Game p5.js Project
This project is a simple drawing game created using the p5.js library. The purpose of this project is to explore the different aspects of p5.js in a creative and interactive way.

## ➤ Overview
This 'Drawing Game' is a simple game in which the player draws lines to guide the correct ball (drawn as a green ball) into the endzone (drawn as a simple blue house). As the player progresses, the levels get increasingly harder, with an 'enemy' ball being spawned every three levels to add a layer of complexity.
