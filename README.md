## ➤ Overview
This 'Drawing Game' is a simple game in which the player draws lines to guide the correct ball (drawn as a green ball) into the endzone (drawn as a simple blue house). As the player progresses, the levels get increasingly harder, with an 'enemy' ball being spawned every three levels to add a layer of complexity.

## ➤ Gameplay Instructions
After opening the project in your browser, you will be presented with the game screen displaying a few objects:
- The green ball is the object that you want to reach the target.
- The red balls are the objects that you do not want touching the target.
- The blue house is the target for the player. This is where you will be aiming to get the green ball.
- Lines can be drawn for the balls to bounce off of.

## ➤ Future Work
The game should display the correct information to the screen on launch, instead of the console. For this version the game information is only displayed on the console output. [This](https://editor.p5js.org/dariusalasu/sketches/sSWfJSRrg) is the link to the project on the p5.js web editor, with the console displayed.
